### Hi there 
I'm a 2nd year Industrial Production Engineering Undergraduate at Dr. B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar.
My personal interest is doing sports programming for which my preferable language is C++.
I also have the knowledge of DSA
I'm still learning many things like website development and many others
I love to explore new technologies and develop solutions to problems and I seek for internships and freelancing projects.
